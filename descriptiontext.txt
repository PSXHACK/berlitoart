,Painting was born and grew up with me through the years. Art was first true love which filled me up then l get lost in my own inner space...I'm creating on the canvas what I want to express.. this is the body language of my own inner world which is associated with the strength of feminine energy in which I see oneself... l'll keep doing it rest of my life to keep the energy  inside me..
My muse is a strong principled successful ruthless warrior woman despite many obstacles who never backs down to achieve her goals...
Each of my works is associated with individualism, my style is combinations of colors ... l truly believe a real artist does not have to look like anyone else, an artist puts his own spirit into his art which can't be copied.
There is so much infectious emotion in my works that it is impossible not to feel it and follow it..
One's creativity is a unique manifestation of human abilities that can create life out of life
I mainly draw strong women and this emotion belongs to everyone... inner strength creates my art..
A person can do anything within the limits of his personal imagination, the main thing is not to make him believe that he can't do something...as long as he believes in his own ability, he can do anything.
